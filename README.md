## **1. Trajectory planning**(Python)
Trajectory planning and delivery is one of the most common problems in logistics, going from point A to point B using the fastest route is a classical problem in Computer Science for which multiple algorithms have been developed, in this project a methaeuristic algorithm is proposed, creating a visualization tool using PyGame, the vertex generated by the trajectory are used for generating Voronoi Cells.  Each of the voronoi cells represent an area that needs to be covered by one of the delivery vehicles. 
## **2. Methane Reduction**(Python) 
This work shows the programming of simplex optimization method, for finding the optimals values in the diet of cows, for the reduction of methane. 

## **3. Graph Neural Cellular Automata**(Pytorch)

## **4. Deep Diffussion Models**(Pytorch)
The following work proposes modification to the usual operations 
ToDO: 
Train fully and extract weights,  
## **5. Drug interaction modelling**(Python)
This project proposes a techniche for modelling drug interaction based on directed graph and spectral clustering analysis
ToDO: 
- Still lacks web deployment 
- Easy query extraction based on other drug
## **6. Unity simulation**(C#)

## **7. Detection of Corn plague OpenCV**(C++)

## **8. Reinforcement learning games**(JavaScript)


## **9. Stastical analysis and regression**(R) 
This work analyses data
