## **1. Trajectory planning**(Python)
Trajectory planning and delivery is one of the most common problems in logistics, going from point A to point B using the fastest route is a classical problem in Computer Science for which multiple algorithms have been developed, in this project a methaeuristic algorithm is proposed, creating a visualization tool using PyGame, the vertex generated by the trajectory are used for generating Voronoi Cells.  Each of the voronoi cells represent an area that needs to be covered by one of the delivery vehicles.

## **2. Methane Reduction in cattle feed fermentation**(Python)
Methane is the second most polluting greenhouse gas produced by human activity representing 10.2% of the greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. for the year 2017, the main source of this due the methane eructation produced by enteric fermetation.

In a study by [*Roque (2021)*](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247820), shows how the introduction of the algae [*asparagopsis taxiformis*](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagopsis_taxiformis) can decrease methane emissions due to fermentation in 75% with a medium forrage diet.

This project proposes and equation that represent the diets given to cows, aiming to find the optimal parameters in diet of the animal to reduce methane production. 
This project implements the Simplex Method for finding the minimum points. 
The equation proposed: 

$$\frac{7.15h + 7338c + 1.5g + 55u + 17.2p + 26.3f + 0.88a + 0.42r + 307k + 0.15i}{52}$$

Where: 
h is the hydrogen produced, c is the CO<sub>2</sub> produced, g is the kilograms gained, u is the percentage of humid pasture in the diet, p is the percetange of protein, f is the percentage of fat, a is the percentage of ash, r is the percentage of carbohydrates, k is the amount of calories, 
i is the percetange of idione.
With the following restrictions for the case of the Simplex method:

1. $$55u + 17.2p + 26.3f + 0.88a + 0.42r + 0.15i = 100$$
2. $$1 < h < 2$$
3. $$0 < c < 0.7$$
4. $$1 <= u$$
5. $$1 <= p$$
6. $$1 <= f$$
7. $$1 <= a$$
8. $$1 <= r$$
9. $$1 <= r$$
10. $$1 <= k$$
11. $$1 <= i$$


*With the following results* 
| Method| h | c | g | u | p | f | a | r | k| i | **Point found** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |  
| Simplex| 666.6 | 1 | 0.7 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1| 1 | **240.62** |

ToDo: 
- Create graph that allows to visualize the point.   

## **3. Deep Diffussion Models**
The following work proposes modifications to the usual operations for classical denoising diffusion probabilistic models, for generating text-to-video, as defined by [*Ho (2020)*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239), 
There it is defined: 
```math

The [*Sympathetic nervous system*](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23262-sympathetic-nervous-system-sns-fight-or-flight#:~:text=Your%20sympathetic%20nervous%20system%20is,in%20danger%20or%20physically%20active.) is a system that controls 
This work analyses data from Sloan in an study that noted that cardiac sympathetic activation and parasympathetic withdrawal result in heart rate increases during psychological stress. 

Power spectral analysis of heart period variability also provides estimates of cardiac autonomic nervous system activity. 
The authors conducted a study to determine the relationship between neurohumoral and two different spectral estimates of cardiac sympathetic nervous system activity during a quiet resting baseline and in response to a psychologically challenging arithmetic task. 

Subjects were healthy, medication-free male and female volunteers with a mean age of 37.8 years. None had a history of cardiac, respiratory, or vascular disease. Among the data collected were the measurements on E, NE, low-frequency (LF) and very-low-frequency (VLF) power spectral indices, and low-frequency/high-frequency ratios (LH/HF). Measurements are given for three periods: baseline (B), a mental arithmetic task (MA), and change from baseline to task (DELTA). 
This analyses aims to find important relations and insights from the dataset. 

**Methdology**
- Do normality test for all variables. Use shapiro-willks test. 
- Find strong correlations between variables. This in order to reduce the number of variables in the problem. 
- Determine if task has an effect on predictor variables. Use friedmann-test.
- Compute a linear model.
